# JDVELH Collection - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1992

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

A fan of the books you are the hero of when I was a teenager, and a great adventure game player ([L'Aigle d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Aigle_d%27Or), [I.L. L'intrus](http://dcmoto.free.fr/programmes/il-l-intrus/index.html), [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_(video_game)), [The Bard's Tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard%27s_Tale) and of course [Sierra On-Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment), [Delphine Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_Software_International) and [Lucasarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm_Games)) at the time, having coded a few games in the same style on [Thomson TO7-70](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_TO7/70), [Thomson TO9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_TO9) and [Atari 1040ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST), I also threw myself into writing several adventures and coding them on PC under MS-Dos with [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) in 1991 and 1992.

The source codes present in this code repository and the compiled programs correspond to these 3 adventures in French:

* The Key to Wealth (01/1992)
* The Master of Masters' medallion (02/1992)
* How to warn the Masters (07/1992)

You'll only be able to play it under MS-Dos or with an emulator, or perhaps recompile the whole thing with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) for the Windows or Linux terminal.

Like almost all my software at the time, these games were distributed by Distri Soft Club and [Pressimage](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressimage). At the time, everything was distributed by mail or downloaded from BBSs and premium-rate telephone services.

I used my text display module with hyperlinks. The hypertext file editor was also distributed. I don't know if other people did anything with it, but it was first in my top 10 according to the stats provided by Distri Soft Club on 30/10/1992. Its source codes are on [this code repository]. A more modern version will be made one day so that the corresponding files can be reopened and perhaps converted to HTML.

It's possible that these programs are compilable with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) but I haven't tried. Units not supplied can be found in the [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal) repository. If any are missing, please let me know so that I can add them.
